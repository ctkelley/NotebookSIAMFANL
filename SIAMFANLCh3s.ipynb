That is not the case, however, for the linear solves. One can only get mesh-independence for the linear solve if the preconditioner is so good that it essentially converts the problem into an integral equation. For the H-equation and the convection-diffusion (both preconditioned and not), vary the grid size and see how the iteration statistics change. Use both full GMRES and the low-storage solvers.
