That is not the case, however, for the linear solves. One can only get mesh-independence for the linear solve if the preconditioner is so good that it essentially converts the problem into an integral equation. For the H-equation and the convection-diffusion (both preconditioned and not), vary the grid size and see how the iteration statistics change. Use both full GMRES and the low-storage solvers. You will want to make figures like the ones earlier in this chapter that plot residual norm against both the number of nonlinear iterations and the number of Jacobian-vector products."
