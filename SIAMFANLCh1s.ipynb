    "Looking at the itereation history can help you find errors or convince you that things are going well. One simple thing we will do often is to plot a semilog graph of the residual history. If we are comparing methods, it is a good idea to plot $|f(x_n)|/|f(x_0)|$ to that all the plots will begin at the same point. Here is a simple version of that. I like to label things, so I did that too. Since I'll be publishing this as a print book, I'll make the curves black to save on publication costs."
