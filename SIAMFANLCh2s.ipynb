    "For sufficiently large dimension, the linear algebra cost will dominate the computation. Time should increase by roughly a factor of 8 as the dimension doubles because our LU factorization takes $O(N^3)$ operations. We see that with this computation. Increasing the dimension from 1024 to 4096 did increase the runtimes by (roughly) a factor of 64 and we see that using single precision Jacobians cuts the run time in half. Note also that the single precision Shamanskii run is now five times faster than the double precision Newton computation. One of the projects at the end of this chapter challenges you to increase the dimension and compare the timings as you do that. Remember that we allocated storage for the Jacobian when we defined ```FPS```, so @btime is not measuring the allocation for the Jacobian."

We will explore that for the boundary value problem, where we can use [BandedMatrices.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMatrices/BandedMatrices.jl) and __qr!__ for the linear solver. __qr!__ supports single precision linear algebra, so we will use that. __lu!__ does not, so the support is not consistent.\n",

    "Updating the Jacobian less frequently has a smaller impact than in the case of the H-equation. You should expect this because the linear solver costs $O(N)$ work rather than $O(N^3)$ and the Jacobian is updated for the early iterations because the residual is not decreasing fast enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other interesting feature of this computation is that the single precision results differ in a meaningful way from the double precision results. The reason for this is that the Jacobian is ill-conditioned enough to affect the quality of the single precision solver. The condition number of the Jacobian is $O(N)$, so for $N=10^5$ one should expect different results from the linear solve in single precision, and that's what you get.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the benchmark results say that there is no benefit from doing the linear algebra in single precision. This is also no surprise since the factorization is $O(N)$ work.\n",

    "The reader should try this problem with $N=10^6$ and watch the line search fail for the single precision linear algebra computations. That is also no surprise with an inaccurate Newton direction."
