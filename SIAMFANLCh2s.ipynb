    "The moral here is pretty clear. We see that compute time is cut by a factor of at least two over Newton's method in all cases. The result for an analytic Jacobian with linear algebra in single precision and ```sham=5``` is 19 times faster than our slowest computation (Newton + finite difference Jacobian + double precision linear algebra). So, do less linear algebra and do it in single precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will increase the dimension. As we do that the computation becomes more burdensome, so we will only do four cases, all with an analytic Jacobian. The size of this example is large enough to clearly show the factor of two reduction in cost one gets from a single precision Jacobian.\n",

    "For sufficiently large dimension, the linear algebra cost will dominate the computation. Time should increase by roughly a factor of 8 as the dimension doubles because our LU factorization takes $O(N^3)$ operations. We see that with this computation. Increasing the dimension from 1024 to 4096 did increase the runtimes by (roughly) a factor of 64 and we see that using single precision Jacobians cuts the run time in half. Note also that the single precision Shamanskii run is now five times faster than he double precision Newton computation. One of the projects at the end of this chapter challenges you to increase the dimension and compare the timings as you do that. Remember that we allocated storage for the Jacobian when we defined ```FPS```, so @btime is not measuring the allocation for the Jacobian."

    "If the Jacobian is sparse and you use the solvers from __SuiteSparse__ then you cannot use single precision. Even if the structure of the Jacobian allows you to use the LAPACK solvers or a special-purpose package, there is less benefit in using single precision for linear algebra than in the dense case. We will explore that for the boundary value problem, where we can use [BandedMatrices.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMatrices/BandedMatrices.jl) and __qr!__ for the linear solver. __qr!__ supports single precision linear algebra, so we will use that. __lu!__ does not, so the support is not consistent.\n",

    "Updating the Jacobian less frequently has a smaller impact than in the case of the H-equation. You should expect this because the linear solver costs $O(N)$ work rather than $O(N^3)$ and the Jacobian is updated for the early iterations because the residual is not decreasing fast enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other interesting feature of this computation is that the single precision results differ in a meaningful way from the double precision results. The reason for this is that the Jacobian is ill-conditioned enough to affect the quality of the single precision solver. The condition number of the Jacobian is $O(1/N)$, so for $N=10^5$ one should expect poor results from the linear solve in single precision, and that's what you get.\n",
