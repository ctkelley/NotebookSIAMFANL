    "For sufficiently large dimension, the linear algebra cost will dominate the computation. Time should increase by roughly a factor of 8 as the dimension doubles because our LU factorization takes $O(N^3)$ operations. We see that with this computation. Increasing the dimension from 1024 to 4096 did increase the runtimes by (roughly) a factor of 64 and we see that using single precision Jacobians cuts the run time in half. Note also that the single precision Shamanskii run is now five times faster than the double precision Newton computation. One of the projects at the end of this chapter challenges you to increase the dimension and compare the timings as you do that. Remember that we allocated storage for the Jacobian when we defined ```FPS```, so @btime is not measuring the allocation for the Jacobian."
